#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is the application of engineering principles to software development to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software systems. It involves structured methodologies, programming practices, testing, and maintenance to ensure software quality and functionality.

 **Importance in the technology industry**
 
  •	Ensures that software is scalable, secure, and maintainable.
	•	Reduces development costs and time by following structured approaches.
	•	Helps in managing complexity by using frameworks, methodologies, and best practices.
	•	Enhances collaboration among teams, improving efficiency and innovation.
	•	Supports industries like healthcare, finance, and entertainment by providing high-quality software solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


   Some of the key milestones in the evulation of software engineering include;

   **1950s–1960s**: Birth of Software Engineering
    Early software development was unstructured and lacked formal methodologies. The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering introduced the term “software engineering” 
    to address the software crisis, where projects were failing due to poor planning and execution.

  **1970s–1980s**: Structured Programming & Waterfall Model
   Developers started using structured programming (breaking programs into smaller, reusable modules), and the Waterfall Model became a standard for software development, 
   introducing phases like planning, design, implementation, and maintenance.

 **1990s–2000s**: Agile Development & Open Source Revolution
  The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced iterative and flexible software development methods, focusing on customer collaboration and rapid development. Additionally, open- 
  source projects like Linux and Apache gained popularity, making software more accessible and customizable.

 **2010s–Present**: Cloud Computing, DevOps & AI in Software Engineering)
  The rise of cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) has changed how software is deployed and maintained. DevOps practices improved software delivery, and AI-powered 
  automation is now shaping the future of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** consists of structured steps that guide software development from planning to deployment. The key phases include:
  
   •	Requirement Analysis – Understanding customer needs, gathering functional and non-functional requirements.
	 •	Planning – Defining project scope, cost estimation, scheduling, and risk assessment.
	 •	Design – Creating software architecture, database structures, and UI/UX designs.
   •	Implementation (Coding) – Writing and testing the actual code based on design specifications.
	 •	Testing – Identifying and fixing bugs through unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
	 •	Deployment – Releasing the software to production, ensuring smooth operation.
	 •	Maintenance & Updates – Addressing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

   | Feature            | Waterfall Model | Agile Model |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| *Approach*      | Linear, sequential | Iterative, flexible |
| *Changes*       | Difficult to accommodate | Easy to adapt |
| *Client Involvement* | Minimal until the end | Continuous feedback |
| *Development Speed* | Slower, each phase must finish before the next | Faster, frequent releases |
| *Documentation* | Heavy documentation | Light documentation, working software is prioritized |
| *Example Use Cases* | Large projects with fixed requirements (e.g., Military software, Banking systems) | Startups, Web apps, SaaS products that need quick updates |

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
